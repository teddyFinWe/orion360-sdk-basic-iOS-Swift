## Introduction

The Orion360™ SDK Pro for iOS is a developer library to easily build and implement mobile applications that utilize immersive 360° video and 360° image content.

360° video/image is a special type of content that covers the complete surroundings of the camera. Using our SDK, 360° content can be included into mobile apps easily.
StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

## Overview

The Orion360 SDK Pro for iOS provides a new iOS library that can be included to 3rd party iOS apps and that greatly simplifies building an app that supports 360° video/image content.

Using our SDK showing a single 360° video/image from the remote URL or from local file system requires only a few lines of code. This is achieved by providing a 360° video/image player component which enables the player to be simply dropped into a UI layout and initialized with a handler to 360° video/image.

In short, Orion360 contains one main component “OrionView” and its purpose is to view and play 360-degree content.

## Prerequisites

The Orion360 SDK for iOS requires the standard development environment for iOS apps (Xcode Developer Tool).

## Supported Devices

Orion360 for iOS supports all iOS devices starting iOS version 7.0.

## Installation

The easiest way to take the SDK to use is to utilize the CocoaPods framework.

What is CocoaPods?

CocoaPods is the dependency manager which takes care of frameworks and third-party dependencies for your Xcode Projects. To use Orion360 SDK in your project, you need to install CocoaPods. Please follow installation guide below.

Note: If CocoaPods is already installed on your Mac you can skip this.

To check if CocoaPods is already installed or not, Open terminal and type the following command and press Return key (↵).

	pod install ↵

If CocoaPods is not installed, the following error log will be shown on terminal

	-bash: pod: command not found

### CocoaPods installation guide:

On terminal type, the following command and press Return key.

	sudo gem install cocoapods ↵

Note: Your machine might ask for your system password, type your password and press Return key. (Tip: you will not be able to see what you are typing while entering your password, make sure you press Return key after you finish entering your password). If the correct password is given CocoaPods will start the process of installation.

You can read more about CocoaPods and installation guide on: [http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation)

Figure 5. OrionImageViewer’s project workspace

As seen in Figure 5, CocoaPods is not yet added to our project. Step 2 of this documentation will guide you through CocoaPods and SDK installation.

## Getting started with Podfile

Go to terminal and navigate to project directory (OrionImageViewer). You can navigate using two ways. Either by navigating to project directory using cd \[type directory name\] or simply type cd and drag & drop your project directory on terminal and terminal will insert directory path for you, then press Return key.

	cd <drag and drop your project folder> ↵

## Create Podfile

Type pod init and press Return key to create empty pod file for your project directory. Podfile is what you use to specify all the required libraries for your project.

	pod init ↵

After running pod init Podfile is added to your project directory.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qoHpIQ3p-3SPyCD-gnjsdj7OnEEzC8D0LlUdWTgycavalj6bkZvBzmjEXlQxUB3FTCmLJP77VRHCDGWKrGRQfkS4gRl0sy-FmVPRdm2kKLdq9UvfeTJB35xMgG4vie91SrRmX9gI)

Figure 6. OrionImageViewer’s directory after pod init

## Open Podfile in edit mode

Type the following command on the terminal to open Podfile in edit mode.

	open -e Podfile ↵

After opening the Podfile, you Podfile contents will look like Figure 7

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/N69deL_RUoXdwC32CA-LRquZ6y-FiC2IDSfN5l83I5M7Gi8rdK8Y5RMUmD4lMc2whS4BAjLM463Txw_puOIbzvtjRieZ_6g4CVbwAXwtC-GTTL_PD76VVB2cFfQnDnnB3C832yT0)

Figure 7. Podfile content before being edited

## Edit the Podfile

Edit the Podfile content as follows to Install Orion360 SDK Basic for iOS:

	source 'https://github.com/FinweLtd/PodSpecs_Prd.git'  
	source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'  
	  
	target 'OrionImageViewer' do  
	\# Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks  
	use_frameworks!  
	  
	\# Pods for OrionImageViewer  
	pod 'OrionSDK'  
	end

## Adding Orion360 SDK to our project

After saving the updates you made on Podfile, go to terminal and type the following command and press Return key (↵)

	pod install ↵

After few minutes you will see a log something like Figure 8 on your terminal.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CCo9K1PYVYOLGJpaxqh_vC_9xQ6nMQPoM-bW-w7fvWsZb8958I5O8uxGPLkthZKGRrKe1LHRDKuPC3cj2JIxkIn9hBGagHwHHqjKonDMivFQ9JcDOXCeDz_lJzJKRJn-ITnhjAFt)

Figure 8. Orion360 SDK installation completed

If you see message “Pod installation complete!”, you are ready to add our Orion360 SDK to your project and start to have fun :)

Open project directory and you will see OrionImageViewer.xcworkspace added (see Figure 9)

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aM6eeN_a5fLxScgz2YhXz7UAY51Uh9XYsoIrIXM5BnYW2xwysuckqoBq_F1VSlD6GIg9VPSlIkAw6Yzw0TQURC5hYbq9F7bp0Dc3H1RlSeXVU8XWeQoPqalvSIdh01FjfPQ925WP)

Figure 9. Project directory’s content after successful pod installation.

## Start new Xcode session

After successful pod installation, on the terminal you will see:

\[!\] Please close any current Xcode sessions and use \`OrionImageViewer.xcworkspace\` for this project from now on.

Close opened Xcode project and open `OrionImageViewer.xcworkspace`. From here on you should work on `OrionImageViewer.xcworkspace’.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oBEZcDVaAwHDXCC9ZEzsSQs_MfFpkVBNFeDl4pKmn3sPrMhe97MZdkM9LtK9M85V_PDGAbbZNmDdv87aljsqTk52hULc1nVmwWVXxp-K7tBKVpO4Q7p-QsoscQJ_K2iAHxyFCvTW)

Figure 10. OrionImageViewer.xcworkspace.

Notice: Whenever there will be a new update to the Orion360 SDK, go back to Step 2 and write pod update command and press Return key, and SDK will be updated right away.

	pod update ↵

## Working on OrionImageViewer xcworkspace

After opening OrionImageViewer.xcworkspace you can see the SDK is successfully added to our project (see Figure 11).

Figure 12. Sequence diagram:Orion1View

The Orion360 SDK can be used for both Objective-C and swift project. For Objective-C project you simply import Orion1View (#import <Orion1View.h>) header and initialize it as follows:

	Orion1View orion1View = \[\[Orion1View alloc\] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.bounds.size.width, self.view.bounds.size.height)\];  
	orion1View.delegate = self;

  

Note that the license file need to be given.

	NSString\* path = \[\[NSBundle mainBundle\] pathForResource:@"license.key.lic" ofType:nil\];  
	NSURL *licenseURL = \[NSURL fileURLWithPath:path\];

  

For Swift projects you need to create bridging header. Please follow Step 9. (For Objective-C projects, skip Step 9 and jump to Step 10 to learn how you can acquire Orion360 SDK)

  

## Objective-C bridging header for Swift projects

Create bridging header as follows:

File > New > File > (iOS, watchOS, tvOS, or macOS) > Source > Objective-C File

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GkGZSX-QKBn5kDJSWIgVw6V5uLcFscWjO3KKn173Xbhx28v5ljfJlLyyCCWO4xAGFNCKA0QfmlBUug2pYBRqx65DSoKtOVQ55LcEIM4kBrTKEZQRv8-T2fivvk7y0MndtaMddxwG)

Figure 14. Create new Objective-C file for bridging header

Give file name which is similar to your project name for this example "OrionImageView" and press Next, and save it in the same directory as your project.

If you accept, Xcode creates the header file along with the file you were creating, and names it by your product module name followed by "-Bridging-Header.h". When you press Create you will see a dialog message (see Figure 15) and click on “Create Bridging Header”

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vYFF5AFYNpw5bMUy5Skfo1pt3VBOQiXmjzejPdDPq8ene5JY0OcOIF8Rv6W7Qnszi3oppQHxQAyxCnP4Yp6g7lakWHtfYanJBXzO9j70rtGsj0EcxM68vpmV5XOAWNn6n6x-iJ7b)

Figure 16. OrionImageViewer’s project structure after creating bridging header

Now open OrionImageViewer-Bridging-Header.h and type #import "Orion1View.h" and save the file.

Figure 17. Importing Orion360 SDK using import statement

 After creating bridging header find the  class line, which should look like this:
	 class  ViewController: UIViewController {
    
After UIViewController, add a comma (,) and  Orion1ViewDelegate and initialize Orion1View as follows:

	let orionView = Orion1View(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: view.bounds.size.width, height: view.bounds.size.height))  
	orionView.delegate = self

And license file is given as follows:

	let path: String? = Bundle.main.path(forResource:"Orion360\_SDK\_Basic\_iOS\_Trial_finwe.OrionSimpleVideoPlayer.lic", ofType: nil)  
  

let licenseUrl = URL(fileURLWithPath: path ?? "")

## Obtaining License File

To show 360° content you need a license file that must be added to your app project's resources without any modification. Failure to do so will result to black video player screen and currently, it doesn't produce any warning messages.

Orion360 SDK is a commercial product and requires a license file to work. An evaluation license is provided with the sample app. You can get a watermarked evaluation license file also for your own bundle identifier by creating an account to [https://store.make360app.com](https://store.make360app.com/), starting a new SDK project, providing your own package name, and selecting FREE Trial.

Please follow these steps to obtain License File:
1.  Go to  [https://store.make360app.com](https://store.make360app.com/)
    
2.  Sign in if you have an existing account with us or Sign up if you are a new user.
